# Simple Blog with JSONPlaceholder

This project is part of the course Floripa Mais Tec.

Leia em [pt-br](./README.md).

The main objective was to use fetch, async await and rest/spread operators to get posts information from JSONPlaceholder API and populate a page with, also when a post is clicked it should open a modal that loads the post and it's comments.

Besides the requested, I also added a intersectionObserver to load more posts when the user reaches the final post.
